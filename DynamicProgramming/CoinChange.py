Problem
Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite supply of each of
S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued //coins, how many ways can we make the change?
The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.
For example, for N = 4 and S = [1, 2, 3], there are four solutions:
[1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2], [2, 2], [1, 3].
So output should be 4.

For N = 10 and S = [2, 5, 3, 6], there are five solutions:
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3, 3], [2, 2, 6], [2, 3, 5] and [5, 5].
So the output should be 5.
